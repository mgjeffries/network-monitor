## Internet Monitor Setup

### Quickstart:
1. Plug it in!
1. Wait 5 mins
1. Check the status page: https://floaty-internet.betteruptime.com/. It should show "Connected"

### Troubleshooting

If the device can't connect to Floaty's network, it will create its own wifi network, called `Internet_Monitor_Setup`. You can connect any computer / phone to this device, and use it to change the network name and password that the device monitors. The following instructions show how to reset the device, and go through this process from scratch, although you may be able to do just a part of this process.

1. Press the button on the device labeled `b` to reset the device and restart it
1. Use a computer or phone to connect to the `Internet_Monitor_Setup` wifi network
1. Wait for the config page to be automatically displayed, or go to http://192.168.4.1
1. Click "Configure Wifi"
1. Enter the name and password for the wifi network you want to connect to, and click "Save"
